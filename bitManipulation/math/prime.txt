a prime number have only two divisors 1 and the number itself

brute force will be run a loop from 1 to n

count all the divisors, if there exists more than two divisors, return as false;

else return as true;

we can optimise it further by using the same observations we got in finding the divisors in sqrt(n) time

if we get a number between 2 and sqrt(n) that divides n we return false
else return true;
