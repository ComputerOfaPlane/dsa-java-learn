given a number find all the divisors of the number

suppose a number = 60

divisors are = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 12, 20, 30, 60

we need to print these

brute force way will be running a loop from 1 to 60
then for each i check if n%i==0

we can optimise this by observind

dvisiors are:

1 x 60
2 x 30
3 x 20
5 x 12
6 x 10

we get both of the divisors in the form 

i x n/i

i will got upto sqrt(n)
