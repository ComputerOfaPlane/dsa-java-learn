A binary search tree is a special type of binary tree in which nodes are arranged in a specific order

given a node, its left child will be smaller than it,
given a node its right child will be smaller than it

all the values in the left sub tree will always be smaller
all the values in the right sub tree will always be bigger

generally same values are not allowed, but

we can mitiage around this by either doing left<=root<right or left<root<=right
or just store the frequency as another parameter in the node

since it is a binary search tree, inorder traversal will be a sorted list

smallest element of a bst tree will be the leftmost leaf
largest element will be the rightmost leaf
