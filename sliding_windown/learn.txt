4 patterns:

1. constant window of some size
    -> populate the window, then remove one from left and add one to right

2. longest subarray/substring where <condition>
left=0, right=0
while(right<n){
    // add the right element to the window
    while(condition not holding true) {
        shrik the window
    }
    right += 1
}

3. no. of subarrays/substrings where <condition>
    same template but 

4. shortest subarray/substring where <condition>
    similar to (2) just in shrink step, shrink the window to maximum possible situation
